The U.S. military says it has called off the search for three U.S. Marines who are missing after their tilt-rotor aircraft crashed into the sea Saturday off Australia’s east coast. Twenty-three other people aboard the MV-22 Osprey have been rescued. A Marine Corps statement says they have begun a recovery effort in coordination with Australian defense forces.
