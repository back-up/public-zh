# 委内瑞拉反对派掌控的议会9日通过了一项决议，宣称该国总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗因没能履行自己的职责而“放弃职务”。不過最高法院隨即宣佈該決議無效。 

Venezuela’s Supreme Court has annulled parliament’s resolution aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro. The Court ordered them to stop the “political trial” against the president, since it is not within its constitutional authority.
