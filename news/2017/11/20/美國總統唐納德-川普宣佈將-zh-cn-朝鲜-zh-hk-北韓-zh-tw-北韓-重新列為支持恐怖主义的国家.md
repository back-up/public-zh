The United States is returning North Korea to its list of states sponsoring terrorism after a 10-year absence, a move that will put additional financial and diplomatic pressure on the Pyongyang government."It should have happened years ago," President Donald Trump said Monday from the White House, calling North Korea a "murderous regime."The U.S. Treasury Department will officially announce the designation and further sanctions on Pyongyang on Tuesday, Trump said.
