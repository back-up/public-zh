# 匈牙利總理奧班·維克多對歐洲近期瀕臨失控的偷渡潮提出警告，表示對移民「來者不拒」的做法將會導致歐洲完蛋。 

It is the responsibility of Hungary to show strength in protecting its borders and a bad idea to agree to taking a certain quota of refugees, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said this morning in his fortnightly interview with state-owned Kossuth radio. “We can’t let everyone in, this would be the end of Europe,” he said.
