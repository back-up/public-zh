##### 加州大學伯克利分校法學院
# 加州大學伯克利分校法學院決定將與學院緊密相聯的名字波爾特（Boalt），從學院所有團體、活動等事物的名稱中刪除，也會建議校方將學院以波爾特命名的大樓改名，因為波爾特被發現曾鼓吹排華法案，宣揚仇視美國華人言論。波爾特的遺孀曾捐贈學院以興建大樓，故此大樓以她的丈夫命名，且成為學院的非正式名字。 

The dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law said he has accepted a recommendation to remove the name “Boalt” — associated with the school for more than a century — because its namesake was a racist and never a student there. John Boalt, a Nevada lawyer who inspired the infamous Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, also spoke derisively about Native Americans and people of African descent. His name is sprinkled throughout the school: the Boalt Hall Alumni Association, Boalt Hall Fund, Boalt Hall Student Association, Boalt Environmental Law Society and, perhaps most incongruously, the Boalt Hall Committee on Human Rights. Even the school’s Facebook page is called “UC Berkeley School of Law, Boalt Hall.” Alumni call themselves Boalties.
