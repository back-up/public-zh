# 由於美国参议院未能於1月19日晚上12時之前通過臨時預算法案，美國聯邦政府除必要部門之外，大部分聯邦機構於1月20日開始暫停運作，數十萬聯邦政府僱員被迫停薪休假 

Democrats and Republicans showed few signs of agreement Saturday, just hours after a funding bill was blocked in the Senate beginning a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. Spending authority expired at midnight Washington time, triggering a halt of non-essential functions. Lawmakers are at odds over a range of defense spending and immigration issues, including a legislative fix for nearly 800,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Senators resumed debate Saturday afternoon on a temporary spending bill that would fund the government through February 8.
