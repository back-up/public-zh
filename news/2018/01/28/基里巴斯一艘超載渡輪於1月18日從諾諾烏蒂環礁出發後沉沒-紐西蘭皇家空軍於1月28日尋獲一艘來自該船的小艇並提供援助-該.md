Six adults and an unconscious baby were found Sunday after floating for more than a week in a small wooden boat in the Pacific Ocean. The New Zealand Air Force found the dinghy as it searched for survivors of a ferry that sank as it traveled between two islands in the remote nation of Kiribati. The air force crew was able to drop supplies, including water and food, to the survivors. "The group seem very relieved to have been found," John Ashby from the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre said . The MV Buritaoi, carrying 50 passengers, left Nonouti Island on January 18 on a two-day trip
