# 美國夏威夷州當局在當地時間上午8時許錯誤發出彈道飛彈警報，大量居民隨即緊急疏散，當局在發現誤報後發佈先前警報是誤報的訊息，但手機用戶在收到錯誤警報超過30分鐘後始收到當局發出澄清是誤報的新訊息。 

U.S. Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen said Sunday it was "unfortunate" there was a false emergency alarm about an incoming missile in Hawaii, but said authorities are "all working to make sure it doesn’t happen again."Officials continued to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Saturday incident in which residents of the western-most U.S. state, in the Central Pacific, were erroneously sent emergency alerts on television, radio, email and mobile devices that warned: "BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL."
