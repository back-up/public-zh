##### 巴伐利亚州议会
# 德國巴伐利亚州议会選舉進行投票 

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Bavarian allies are heading for their worst state election result in more than 60 years in a regional vote Sunday that is likely to increase tensions within Germany’s fragile coalition government. According to the latest polls, the Christian Social Union (CSU) will win about 34 percent, losing the absolute majority with which the center-right party has controlled its southeastern heartland for most of the postwar period. Voting stations opened at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and broadcasters are expected to publish exit polls shortly after 6 p.m.
