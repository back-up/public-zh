Officials in Pakistan say at least 74 people have been killed and dozens more injured after fire engulfed a passenger train near Pakistan's Rahimyar Khan city in eastern Punjab province. The train was traveling from the southern city of Karachi to Rawalpindi when the disaster struck. Television footage showed flames pouring out of the train's carriages, sending huge clouds of black smoke into the sky above. Authorities say many of the victims died when they jumped from the moving train to escape the inferno.
