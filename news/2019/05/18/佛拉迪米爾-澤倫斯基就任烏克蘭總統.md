# 佛拉迪米爾·澤倫斯基就任烏克蘭總統。 

Ukrainian TV star Volodymyr Zelenskiy was sworn in as the country's new president on Monday, promised to stop the war in the country's east against Russian-backed separatists and immediately disbanded parliament, which he has branded as a group only interested in self-enrichment. Even before he disbanded the Supreme Rada, which had been one of his campaign promises, the 41-year-old Zelenskiy had upended the traditions of Ukrainian politics. He ditched the idea of a traditional motorcade to his inauguration, walking to the parliament through a park packed with people.
