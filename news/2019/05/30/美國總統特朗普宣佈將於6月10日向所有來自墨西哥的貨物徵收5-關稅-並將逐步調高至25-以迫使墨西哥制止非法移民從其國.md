# 美國總統特朗普宣佈將於6月10日向所有來自墨西哥的貨物徵收5%關稅，並將逐步調高至25%，以迫使墨西哥制止非法移民從其國土進入美國。 

The United States is giving Mexico 10 days to stop illegal migrants from heading north to the U.S. border, or the country will be slapped with tariffs on all of its products.The announcement was made in a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump Thursday evening.“On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,” Trump tweeted.
