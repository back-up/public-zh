# 苏丹阿都拉就任马来西亚第16任最高元首。 

Malaysia's new king formally assumed the throne during a coronation ceremony Thursday in the southeast Asian country. Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah took the oath of office as the country's 16th king during a televised ceremony at the national palace in Kuala Lumpur. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was among the dignitaries in attendance. The 59-year-old Sultan Abdullah, the ceremonial ruler of central Pahang state, succeeds Sultan Muhammad V of northeast Kelantan state, who abruptly resigned on January 6 after barely two years on the throne.
