# 太平洋瓦電公司宣佈與一群保險公司達成和解協議，前者將為2017年和2018年加利福尼亞州山火造成的索賠承擔110億美元。 

Pacific Gas & Electric and a group of insurers announced Friday they reached an $11 billion settlement to cover most of the claims from wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018. The utility said in a statement the tentative agreement covers 85% of the insurance claims from fires that included the one that decimated the town of Paradise and killed 86 people. A group of insurers said in a separate statement the settlement is well below the $20 billion the insurance companies had sought in bankruptcy court.
