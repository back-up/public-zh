# 美國亚拉巴马州遭到龍捲風吹襲，至少23人喪生。 

A tornado roared into southeast Alabama and killed at least 23 people and injured several others Sunday, part of a severe storm system that caused catastrophic damage and unleashed other tornadoes around the Southeast."Unfortunately our toll, as far as fatalities, does stand at 23 at the current time,'' Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told WRBL-TV of the death toll. He added that two people were in intensive care. Drones flying overheard equipped with heat-seeking devices had scanned the area for survivors but the dangerous conditions halted the search late Sunday, Jones said.
