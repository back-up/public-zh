# 也門胡塞武裝組織以導彈和無人機攻擊亞丁一個軍營，造成至少32人喪生。 

Yemen's Houthis are claiming responsibility for a ballistic missile strike that tore through a military parade at a Saudi-coalition airbase near Aden Thursday, killing dozens. A suicide bomber also blew himself up near a police compound in the city, killing over half a dozen people. Sirens went off, and military vehicles surrounded the al-Jalaa camp after a ballistic missile struck a military parade at the Saudi-led coalition airbase in the south of Yemen. Dozens of people were killed or wounded in the explosion, including cadets and top officers, according to Arab media.
