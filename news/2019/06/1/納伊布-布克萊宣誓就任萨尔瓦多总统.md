# 納伊布·布克萊宣誓就任萨尔瓦多总统。 

El Salvador's new President Nayib Bukele took office Saturday pledging to cure the Central American country that he described as a "sick child" following years of violence and migration that has strained relations with the United States.The 37-year-old former mayor of San Salvador, who won more votes than all other candidates in the February presidential election, brought an end to a two-party system that has held sway over the country for three decades."Our country is like a sick child, now it's up to all of us to take care of it," Bukele told the crowd.
