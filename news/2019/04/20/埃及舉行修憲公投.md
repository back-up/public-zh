# 埃及舉行修憲公投 

Egyptians are voting Saturday on constitutional amendments that allow Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi to stay in office until 2030. The voting comes less that a week after parliament approved the changes. Expatriate Egyptians began voting Friday. If passed, the amendments also would deepen presidential powers and military presence within communities.
