# 美国司法部副部長羅德·羅森斯坦 Rosenstein宣佈辭職，將於5月11日離任 

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017 to investigate links between the Russian government and President Donald Trump's campaign, said on Monday he was resigning from his post. Rosenstein's departure, effective May 11, was not a surprise. He had been expected to step down in March.
